The goal of this project was to create a basic app structure in Rails, implementing authentication using Devise. The app allows users to create secret posts, and you can only see who wrote the posts if you are signed in. The project was done as part of The Odin Project - Ruby On Rails - Project: AUTHENTICATION, which can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lnav
